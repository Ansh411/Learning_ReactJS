â­• JSX has HTML like syntax or XML like syntax 

â­•  JSX element == React.createElement

â­• JSX => React.createElement => (JS Object) => Renders it to HTML DOM

â­• JSX is written using "Babel" under Parcel which works as transpiler which transpiled the code to make it React Element then it usual process as it renders to HTML
(It transpiled before it reaches to JS Engine)

â­• In JSX, we define class with "className" and other attributes are also defined with "camelCase"

â­• When we define any JSX element in more than 1 line so we enclose it using parentheses to make sure babel understands it

React components can be any element/tag like a card or a div etc.

 React Components are of two types:

 1. Class Based Components - Older way of using components
 2. Functions based Components - New way and mostly used way

// Point : If we get response from any malicious API and we use it in our components using curly braces as JS file
// then JSX(React) takes care of the malicious file and React automatically escapes it and if possible it sanitize the response to use or does not run in our code

// This is known as cross-site scripting

// Example of cross-site scripting

function App({ message }) {    // This is a component where message is being fetched by API
  return <div>{message}</div>;
}

// Case: 1   Safe Input  API Return => { "message": "Hello, Ansh!" }

// React will safely render it as   =>  Hello Ansh!

// Case: 2  Malicious input API returns => { "message": "<script>alert('You are hacked')</script>" }

// Now React automatically escapes it, so browser shows  => <script>alert('You are hacked')</script> and nothing danger happens => so react protects you
