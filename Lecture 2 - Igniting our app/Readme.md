## Parcel

- Dev Build : It build the app and initialise it
- Local Server : It hosts the app to a local server
- HMR : Hot Module Replacement (It changes the updated code without refreshong the page with the help of parcel cache)

- It uses File Watching Algorithm (keeps track on any changes) : It is written in C++

- It gives faster builds because of the caching

- It also does image optimization

- Bundling

- Minification

- Compress

- Consistent Hashing

- Code Splitting

- Differential Bundling - support older browsers (build different bundles for every version)

- Diagnostic and Error Handling

- HTTPs - for any testing

- Tree Shaking - remove unused code

- Different dev and prod bundles
